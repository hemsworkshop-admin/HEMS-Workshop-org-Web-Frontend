[SCoT - @arch] User (@bo) requested @arch to update code for the archive page. Per locksrules.md, @arch is read-only for src/ and only manages blueprints. Per scrumrules.md (Not My Job protocol), @arch must refuse the task and re-route it to @dev. Will perform Cold Start initialization, refuse the code task, and tag @dev to read the URL and update the page adhering to the no-click constraints.

[SCoT - @dev] Acknowledging re-route from @arch. Need to locate the 2022 archive page component in src/, read the raw HTML of the URL to bypass markdown conversion data loss, extract the missing links/formats, and update the Next.js page. Will use grep to find the page file first.

[SCoT - @dev] Received epic to tighten vertical padding and enhance visual hierarchy of the 2022 Technical Program. Will modify Tailwind utility classes in page.tsx: reduce py-4 to py-2/py-3, add border-l-4 or distinct background colors for Technical Session headers, and use border-b with subtle dashed or lighter borders between individual presentations. No need for a formal implementation plan as this is a localized UI styling update.

[SCoT - @dev] Received epic to adjust time formats and colors. I will update page.tsx to change session/meal times from ranges to start times only, coloring them text-foreground (black/dark grey). Inside presentations, I will extract the start time from the title string and style it as text-foreground/50 (grey). No plan needed for this localized styling change.

[SCoT - @qa] Audited the page.tsx file. Discovered that the presentation times were entirely deleted during the previous 'tighten padding' epic. Returning [FAIL] to @dev. 
[SCoT - @dev] Acknowledged the FAIL from @qa. I will use multi_replace_file_content to restore and correctly format the presentation start times as text-foreground/50 font-mono.

[SCoT - @dev] Encountered a Next.js syntax error 'Unterminated regexp literal'. This is likely due to the Python script incorrectly slicing the array or missing a closing JSX tag when I rewrote the Technical Program block. Using view_file to inspect the end of page.tsx.

[SCoT - @dev] Repaired the 'Unterminated regexp literal' error. Used replace_file_content to remove 4 duplicate closing div tags at the end of the file that were left over from a previous Python array slice.

[SCoT - @arch] Acknowledged the business requirement from @bo. The 2022 Archive page has been designated as the template for all future workshop archives. I will update implementation_plan.md to codify this architectural decision.

[SCoT - @dev] Received epic to create the 2019 Workshop archive page using the 2022 template. The user forgot to provide the URL, but based on the previous URL (14thWS/14thProgram.html for 2022), I will attempt to fetch the 12th or 13th workshop program URL for 2019.

[SCoT - @dev] Received the URL for the 2019 (13th) workshop program. I will fetch the raw HTML, parse it as a flat document, and use it to build out the /archive/2019/page.tsx file following the newly established typography and layout template.

[SCoT - @dev] Fetched the provided URL (13thWS.html) but it only contains the landing page header and navigation links. It does not contain the schedule table. Per the strict navigation constraints ('DO NOT click any links'), I cannot follow the 'Program 2019' link to 13thProgram.html. I will request the exact program URL from @bo.

[SCoT - @dev] Received the authorized URL. I will fetch the raw HTML directly using a Python script to ensure no data is lost during markdown conversion. Then, I will duplicate the 2022 page template to /archive/2019/page.tsx and manually map the 2019 schedule data into the JSX, adhering to the newly established time typography and visual delineations.

[SCoT - @dev] Completed construction of the 2019 Archive page (/archive/2019/page.tsx). The raw HTML was extracted, flattened, and precisely mapped into the global UI template without any loss of data. Returning execution to @bo.

[SCoT - @dev] Received request to update the /archive landing page so the 2019 workshop link points to the newly created internal route. Viewing the archive page source to perform the replacement.

[SCoT - @dev] Successfully updated the archive landing page link. The 13th HEMS Workshop item now points internally to /archive/2019.

[SCoT - @arch] Executing atomic-commit-push workflow. Generating summary: Generated the 2019 HEMS Workshop archive page mapped precisely to the 2022 template layout, resolved a syntax error, and updated the archive routing links. I will update handover.md and the product log.
