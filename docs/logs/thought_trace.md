[2026-04-22T21:10:51] @arch / @ops: Read .agents folder, project_charter.md, implementation_plan.md. Started Next.js local host on port 3001 as @ops. Prepared Cold Start message.

[2026-04-22T22:00:15] @dev: Analyzed the requested URL by bypassing the Brotli compression to read the 14th HEMS schedule content. Extracted the timeline spanning Sept 26-29, 2022. Generated an implementation plan to update the React page src/frontend/src/app/archive/2022/page.tsx with the structured schedule using 'Global Symposium' design tokens. Seeking user approval on whether to hardcode legacy PDF links.

[2026-04-23 21:25:56] @arch SCoT Log:
Task: Create rule for HEMS Workshop scraping.
Logic: Add a new rule 7 under section '5. Development Rules' in .agents/rules/scrumrules.md.
Bypassed Lock Rule 4 with User Permission to modify persona/rule files.

[2026-04-23 21:29:03] @dev SCoT Log:
Task: Translate online webpages for archived workshop.
Logic: @bo requested following links from Archive.html. This violates Rule 7 (HEMS Workshop Scraping Protocol) which explicitly states 'DO NOT click any links'. I am strictly bound by this rule and the No-Fly protocol. I will read the Archive.html page as flat text, extract table text only, skip all links, and explicitly notify @bo about the skipped links.

### @arch SCoT Log
- Attempted to read 'source-material\Old site docs\Prgram links.md' to parse archive links.
- Found the file is completely empty (0 bytes).
- Alerting @bo to either save the file or provide the links.

### @arch SCoT Log
- The file 'Prgram links.md' is now synced and contains 28 links.
- Identified 3 .pdf links that must be skipped per the No-Fly protocol: 7th, 2nd, and 1st program PDFs.
- Will write a Python script to fetch the HTML, extract flat text ignoring structure, and save them as markdown files in source-material/.

### @arch SCoT Log
- Identified rule conflict: Writing translated archives to /source-material violates Lock Rule 1.
- Halting execution to trigger Escape Hatch and notify @bo of skipped PDF files.

### @arch SCoT Log
- @bo moved the links file to docs/ to avoid the source-material read-only lock for the source file.
- @bo did not explicitly grant permission to write the translated files to source-material/, so I will place the translated markdown files in docs/archives_translation/ to respect Lock Rule 1.
- I am writing a Python script to scrape the HTML, extract table text as flat text, skip PDFs, and output the data.

### @arch SCoT Log
- Performed a directory listing of .agents and all its subdirectories (config, personas, rules, state, workflows).
- Verified the presence of various agent definitions, rulesets, state documents, and workflow configurations.

### @arch SCoT Log
- @bo requested to finish completing the conversion of the online workshop archives into the new format.
- The new format requires writing Next.js React code (.tsx files) into the 'src/' directory.
- Per Domain Isolation Locks (Lock Rule 3), @arch cannot modify 'src/'. Only @dev can write to 'src/'.
- This triggers the 'Not My Job' (Misroute) Protocol (ScrumRule 8). I will refuse the task, state my role, and tag @dev to take over.

### @dev SCoT Log
- Accepted handover from @arch to perform the conversion within the 'src/' domain.
- The task requires reading the flat text from the workshop archives (including PDFs) and generating Next.js pages for each.
- I will first inspect the already converted 2022 and 2019 pages to understand the required Next.js structure.
- I will then write a Python script in src/frontend to automate reading the extracted text from docs/archives_translation/ (and fetching the PDFs directly if needed) and generating the .tsx files.

### @dev SCoT Log
- @bo approved the plan with the requirement to programmatically reconstruct the complex Tailwind HTML structure for the remaining 12 workshops.
- @bo warned about bad naming conventions in the links.
- Proceeding to Execution phase: Will create task.md, analyze the flat text, and generate the structured Next.js pages.

### @dev SCoT Log
- Checked src/frontend/src/app/archive/page.tsx. Found it was hardcoded to external links for workshops 1-12.
- Discovered a discrepancy in the years I used for workshops 8-12 versus the actual years listed in the archive page.
- Will fix the years in the generator script, re-generate the pages, clean up the incorrect folders, and then update page.tsx to hook them up internally.

### @dev SCoT Log
- @bo requested to inspect 2022 layout and make all others follow it exactly.
- I will rewrite the generator script to emit the exact Tailwind flex-row/grid classes used in 2022 for the technical program.
- The script will extract Days and Events and map them to the 2022 DOM components (e.g., md:w-32 for time, flex-1 for content).

### @dev SCoT Log
- @bo requested to find a place for logos on the modern workshop archives.
- This involves updating the archive page layout to support an image grid (likely for corporate sponsors).
- I will generate representative sponsor logos using the image generator tool, as placeholders are strictly forbidden.
- I will propose a new 'Corporate Sponsors' grid section beneath the Workshop Resources block.

### @dev SCoT Log
- @bo approved the 'Legacy Corporate Sponsors' grid layout and mockups.
- Proceeding with Execution:
  1. Move generated logos to src/frontend/public/images/sponsors/.
  2. Update generator.py and existing manual pages (2019, 2022).
  3. Re-run generator to inject the logo grid into all archives.

### @team SCoT Log
- @arch: Planning documentation structure. Creating a robust TSX template and ruleset for future agent consistency.
- @dev: Building archive-template.tsx and archive-instructions.md in docs/templates/. Abstracting all variables from the 2022 page.
- @qa: Validating that all Tailwind classes and layout elements perfectly mirror the 2022 baseline design. All structural loops (days, standard events, keynotes, technical sessions) are correctly modularized.

### @dev SCoT Log
- @bo approved the use of PyPDF2/pdfplumber for PDF extraction.
- Action: Writing scratch/flat_text_extractor.py to loop through Program Book Links and save raw text to docs/archives_translation/raw_text/.

### @qa SCoT Log
- Validated the output of scratch/reconstruct_archives.py.
- Confirmed all 12 workshops (1999-2018) were successfully ingested using only flat-text extraction from legacy PDFs and HTML tables.
- Confirmed TSX structures strictly match docs/templates/archive-template.tsx. No structural deviation detected. Legacy standardisation is complete.
## [2026-04-24] @arch: Transitioning to Manual Download Pipeline
- Received directive from @bo to halt automated web crawling due to hangups.
- Modifying implementation plan: @bo will manually download the files into a defined folder structure.
- Folder structure defined: docs/archives_translation/raw_html/[year]_program.html and docs/archives_translation/proceedings/[year]/[filename].
- Updating .agents/state/implementation_plan.md to reflect these architectural changes.

## [2026-04-24] @arch: Executing Manual Download Pipeline Blueprint Update
- @bo approved the manual download strategy.
- Updating .agents/state/implementation_plan.md to replace automated scraper logic with manual download instructions.
- Creating the local staging directory structure (raw_html and proceedings) for @bo to use.
- Awaiting manual download completion from @bo.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Creating Dynamic Download Tracker
- Acknowledged @bo request to build a tracking HTML page for downloads.
- Browsers prevent static HTML files from checking local file existence via JS (CORS on file://).
- Solution: Creating a lightweight Python HTTP server (scratch/download_tracker.py) that serves the HTML and provides a /status API.
- The frontend will auto-poll the /status API every 2 seconds and place a checkmark dynamically as files appear in the raw_html folder.
- Extracted all 28 URLs (Archives + Program Books) from Prgram links.md and mapped to expected filenames.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Enhancing Tracker with Drag-and-Drop
- @bo requested a drag-and-drop feature to directly upload files to the expected folder.
- I will modify scratch/download_tracker.py to accept POST requests with multipart form data.
- The HTML will be updated with a dropzone for each row, allowing the user to drag a file right onto the table row to save it under the expected filename.
- Terminating the old server and restarting the new one on port 18080.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Extracting PDF/PPTX Links for @bo
- @bo clarified they wanted the direct URLs to the individual PDFs and PPTXs, not just the HTML program books.
- The previous crawler hang-ups were likely due to the massive 5GB size of the PDF/PPTX files, not the HTML pages themselves.
- I will write a quick Python script to fetch the 14 HTML program book pages, extract all hyperlink URLs pointing to .pdf, .ppt, and .pptx files, and generate a new download tracker specifically for the proceedings artifacts.
- This bypasses the need for @bo to download the HTML manually.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Adding Direct Download to Tracker
- @bo requested the ability to click a link and have the file download directly to the folder, bypassing the browser's default behavior and drag-and-drop.
- Since browsers block direct downloads to specific local paths without prompts, and CORS blocks cross-origin fetches, I will proxy this through the local Python server.
- I will add a /download_remote endpoint to scratch/download_tracker.py.
- Clicking the button in the UI will trigger the Python server to fetch the URL and save it directly to the proceedings directory.
- This balances manual control (avoiding bot-like crawl crashes) with extreme convenience for the user.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Planning Semantic Metadata Renaming
- @bo requested renaming files automatically to include Workshop Number, Author, and Document Type.
- Created an implementation plan to transition scratch/extract_pdfs.py from regex-based extraction to BeautifulSoup parsing.
- Will use DOM traversal to scrape the author's name from adjacent table cells and infer the type from the link text.
- Presented the plan to @bo and asked for a fallback strategy if author parsing fails on heavily malformed legacy HTML.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Refining Metadata Renaming Plan
- @bo requested to flag and skip downloading any files where the author name is malformed/unparseable.
- @bo also requested a nested folder structure: by workshop number, then by document type.
- I will update the implementation plan to define the target directory as docs/archives_translation/proceedings/[workshop]/[type]/[filename].
- If BeautifulSoup fails to find a valid author name, the link will be excluded from the generated pdf_links.json tracking list.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Executing Semantic Renaming & Folder Tracking
- @bo approved the implementation plan, acknowledging that malformed files will be dropped for now.
- Requested a link in the UI to open the destination folder.
- I will rewrite extract_pdfs.py using BeautifulSoup to scrape context (Workshop, Author, Type) and define the nested paths.
- I will update download_tracker.py to handle nested paths and add a /open_folder endpoint so @bo can click a button in the UI to instantly open Windows Explorer to the target directory.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Tweaking Extraction Logic
- @bo pointed out that some fallbacks generated poor filenames like 'Out_For_This_Workshop_Artifact'.
- This happens when the script parses the 'Download Program' link and grabs the preceding warning text.
- @bo requested to replace the generic 'Artifact' type with 'Oral_Presentation', and explicitly name program links 'Final_Program'.
- I will modify scratch/extract_pdfs.py to detect 'program' in the link text/href and bypass author extraction for those files, hardcoding them as [year]_Final_Program.pdf.
- I will also change the default doc_type from 'Artifact' to 'Oral_Presentation'.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Fixing InvalidURL with Spaces
- @bo flagged that 'Final Program SEPT21.pdf' fails to download.
- Diagnosed the issue: urllib.request fails with http.client.InvalidURL when a URL contains literal spaces.
- I will modify scratch/download_tracker.py to urlparse and quote() the remote URL's path before passing it to urllib.request.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Adding Redirect Map Generation
- @bo requested a record of legacy URLs mapped to future URLs as files are downloaded to support Next.js redirects.
- I will modify scratch/download_tracker.py to dynamically update a docs/archives_translation/redirect_map.json file upon every successful download.
- The future URL will be constructed using the expected path, assuming it will eventually live on Google Cloud Storage or under a /proceedings/ route in the new Next.js site.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Planning Presenter File Ingestion UI
- @bo requested a new HTML/Python interface to handle raw files delivered manually by presenters.
- The interface needs drag-and-drop dropzones that automatically rename arbitrarily named files to our strict semantic format and place them in the correct nested folders.
- It also needs a dropzone for 'workshop participants'.
- I will propose creating scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py, which uses our existing pdf_links.json mapping to generate the drag-and-drop UI, bypassing the need for remote URLs.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Executing Presenter Ingestion UI
- @bo approved the plan: filtering for the 14th workshop only, assuming a .pdf extension for the participants list, and noting the link is on the Workshop Archive page.
- I will build scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py to serve the Drag-and-Drop HTML interface for the 14th workshop.
- I will dynamically inject a custom entry for the '14th_Participants_List.pdf' so it has its own dedicated dropzone.

## [2026-04-24] @arch: Planning Corporate Sponsor Ingestion
- @bo requested a dynamic UI section to upload a variable number of corporate sponsor logos.
- This requires text fields for Company Name and Year of Initial Sponsorship to drive the filename schema.
- Since this metadata is not tied strictly to the 14th workshop proceedings, I propose routing these uploads to a global 'docs/archives_translation/sponsors/' directory.
- The frontend will allow dynamic addition of rows, and the backend will intercept and rename files based on the text inputs.

## [2026-04-24] @arch: Showing Implementation Plan
- @bo requested to see the implementation_plan.md.
- Since @bo has .agents/state/implementation_plan.md open in their editor, I will append the Corporate Sponsor Asset Ingestion plan directly to that file so they can review it natively.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Executing Corporate Sponsor Ingestion UI
- @bo approved the plan. I am taking over execution.
- I will first terminate the running presenter ingestion server.
- Then, I will modify scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py to include the Javascript for dynamic sponsor rows.
- I will also add the '/upload_sponsor' endpoint to parse metadata and store files in docs/archives_translation/sponsors/.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Adding External Link to Sponsor UI
- @bo requested an 'External Link' field for corporate sponsors.
- I will update scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py to include this new input field in the HTML.
- Since this metadata needs to be preserved beyond just renaming the file, I will update the backend /upload_sponsor endpoint to intercept the 'link' parameter and append it to a sponsors_metadata.json file.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Adding Student Award Presenters to UI
- @bo requested a new dynamic section for student award presenters with Name, Affiliate Institute, and Presentation Upload.
- I will update scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py to include a '?? Student Award Presenters' section.
- The frontend will allow dynamic addition of student rows similar to the sponsors section.
- The backend will route uploads to 'proceedings/14th/Student_Award/' and maintain a metadata JSON for the affiliate institutes.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Adding 'Not Provided' Facility to UI
- @bo requested a way to flag missing presentations in the Ingestion UI.
- I will update scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py to add a 'Mark Not Provided' button below each dropzone.
- Clicking this will ping a /mark_missing endpoint that creates a blank '.missing' sidecar file in the staging directory.
- The frontend will detect this sidecar file and visually mark the item as '? Not Provided', hiding the dropzone and considering the row 'handled'.

## [2026-04-24] @dev: Planning Poster Extraction
- @bo requested to extract all posters from the 'Program Summary links with Posters' and add them to the Download Tracker.
- I will first investigate the HTML structure of the 'quicklinkalpha.html' pages to identify how posters are labeled and linked.
- Then I will draft an implementation plan for @bo's approval before running the final extraction.


## [2026-04-25] @arch: Planning Poster Manual Ingestion UI
- @bo requested to add a facility for "poster presentation" in the Tracker, specifically with dynamic fields (Name, Affiliation, Title) and dual drag-and-drop zones for both the Poster Presentation and Abstract (with "Not Provided" buttons).
- I identified that the manual drag-and-drop ingestion UI is actually located in `scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py`, not the standard download tracker.
- I formulated a blueprint (Sub-Plan 9) to expand the existing manual UI to support these requirements, routing the files correctly to `proceedings/14th/Poster/` and `Abstract/` while maintaining a new `poster_metadata.json` ledger.
- I updated `.agents/state/implementation_plan.md` to reflect this new architecture and requested @bo's approval.

## [2026-04-25] @dev: Executing Poster UI Implementation
- Accepted handover from @arch following @bo's "ok go" command.
- Handled a python encoding glitch in the patch script by strictly enforcing UTF-8 processing.
- Automatically injected the HTML framework, Javascript dropzone handlers, and Python routing logic into `scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py`.
- The Tracker UI now successfully supports variable poster ingestion with integrated "Not Provided" capabilities for both posters and abstracts.

### @dev reasoning for Ingestion UI update
- The user requested modifying scratch\presenter_ingestion_ui.py to include a program parsing feature and restructuring the manual ingestion interface.
- As @dev, I am strictly locked to writing in the src/ directory according to Lock Rule #3.
- Attempting to rewrite the UI in scratch/ violates Domain Isolation Locks.
- Before proceeding with the implementation, I must trigger the Escape Hatch protocol and ask the human user for permission to bypass Lock Rule #3, or confirm if the script should be migrated to src/backend/.

### @dev reasoning for Ingestion UI update
- User granted explicit permission to bypass lock and modify scratch/presenter_ingestion_ui.py.
- The request is highly complex and requires parsing a 'program' to dynamically generate presentation fields.
- The format of the 'program' is unknown (PDF vs DOCX vs plain text), making the parsing step ambiguous.
- I will enter Planning Mode, write a formal implementation plan, and ask the user to clarify the program file format before executing code.

### @dev Execution Phase: Ingestion UI
- The user approved the plan but did not specify the program format. I will implement a best-effort parsing endpoint that accepts Text/PDF, falling back to a text-based heuristics approach to extract sessions, times, and authors.
- I will separate the HTML out of the python script into an index.html file for maintainability, but keep it served by the Python HTTP server.
- I will add endpoints to serve all_extracted_links.json for legacy URL autofill.

### @arch SCoT Log: Workshop Manager Architecture
- Received request from @bo to turn the ingestion UI into an interactive 'workshop manager'.
- Goal: Load workshop JSON, select/add workshop, edit content, import legacy info, save local, push to gcloud/git.
- Proposing moving the application from `scratch/` python scripts to a robust web app inside `src/frontend/` or a dedicated Next.js administration portal.
- Drafting `docs/implementation_plan.md` to outline the architecture: React UI, JSON Master Schema, API for file system/git/gcloud interactions.
- Outputting implementation_plan to user for feedback and approval.

### @dev SCoT Log: Accepting Handover for Workshop Manager Execution
- @bo approved the architectural plan ("ok go").
- As @arch cannot write to `src/` due to Lock Rule 3, I am taking over the execution phase.
- I will make the following default decisions since the open questions were not explicitly answered:
  1. `master_workshops.json` will live in `src/frontend/src/data/` for native Next.js imports.
  2. GCloud integration will use `gsutil rsync` via `child_process.exec` since the user is operating this locally.
- Creating the `task.md` artifact to track progress.
- Proceeding to initialize the Master JSON, API Routes, and Manager UI components.

### @ops SCoT Log: Starting Local UI
- @bo requested to run the UI locally.
- I will execute `npm run dev` inside `src/frontend` to start the Next.js development server.
- After starting the server, I will provide the localhost URL to @bo.

### @arch SCoT Log: Planning UI Component Migration
- @bo requested to "begin the migration", referring to migrating the drag-and-drop functionalities from `scratch/ui.html` to the Next.js `/manager` portal.
- I will draft an `implementation_plan.md` detailing the transition of Presentation, Sponsor, Student Award, and Poster upload components into React.
- This will require state sub-arrays inside `master_workshops.json` and dedicated React sub-components to manage the complexity without bloating `page.tsx`.
- Outputting plan to user for approval.

### @dev SCoT Log: Accepting Handover for Component Migration
- @bo clarified the open questions: Program Parsing is deprecated. Fuzzy matching for legacy URLs will be preserved. A data import script is required.
- I am taking over execution as @arch cannot write to `src/`.
- I will create the `DragDropZone`, `PresentationsManager`, `SponsorsManager`, `StudentsManager`, and `PostersManager` components in `src/frontend/src/app/manager/components/`.
- I will then integrate these components into `src/frontend/src/app/manager/page.tsx`.
- Finally, I will write an import script to seed `master_workshops.json` with the legacy data.

### @arch SCoT Log: Planning Data Migration (14th Workshop / 2022)
- @bo requested migrating the 14th Workshop (2022) data into the new `master_workshops.json` format.
- Sources: `src/data/archives/2022.json`, `extracted_poster_links.txt`, `scratch/all_extracted_links.json`.
- Action: I will draft an `implementation_plan.md` outlining how a custom Node.js script will flatten the nested `schedule` from `2022.json` into the `presentations` array, extract `sponsors`, and fuzzy-match the poster links.
- Proceeding to update the implementation plan for @bo's review.

### @dev SCoT Log: Executing 2022 Data Migration
- @bo deferred the architectural decision to me. I have decided that flattening the data into `master_workshops.json` does NOT lose information, because we store `date` and `session` on every presentation object. We can easily reconstruct the nested schedule UI on the frontend.
- I will execute `migrate_2022.js` to parse `src/data/archives/2022.json` and inject it into the 13th index (14th Workshop) of `master_workshops.json`.

### @ops SCoT Log: Running Legacy Download Tool
- @bo requested to run the legacy download tool.
- I started `python scratch/download_tracker.py` as a background process.
- It is serving the interface on `http://localhost:18080`.

### @arch SCoT Log: Planning Dynamic Frontend Compilation
- @bo requested that the "Save and Present" button update the individual workshop frontend template files (e.g., `src/data/archives/[year].json`) so the website updates instantly.
- Problem: `master_workshops.json` is a flat database of talks/sponsors, whereas `[year].json` contains a nested `schedule` that includes social `events` (e.g. Breakfast, Receptions) which we don't track in the new UI.
- Solution: The `/api/manager/save` route must perform a smart merge. It will load the existing `[year].json`, wipe only the `session` type items, reconstruct them from our flat `presentations` and `posters` arrays (grouping by `date` and `session`), and then merge them back with the intact `event` items.
- Action: I am drafting this compilation strategy in the `implementation_plan.md` artifact for @bo's approval before modifying the save route.

### @arch SCoT Log: Pivoting to Full Data Mastery
- @bo rejected the smart merge strategy and requested that the Manager UI be updated to track non-technical events as well.
- This is a superior architecture because `master_workshops.json` becomes the absolute single source of truth for 100% of the workshop data.
- Action: I will update the Implementation Plan to include an `EventsManager` component. The `/api/manager/save` route will then dynamically build the `[year].json` schedule from scratch (combining presentations, posters, and events) rather than performing a complex merge.

### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Full Data Mastery
- @bo approved the "Full Data Mastery & Compilation Blueprint".
- Action: I will construct the `EventsManager.tsx`, mount it in `page.tsx`, execute the updated `migrate_2022.js` to ingest the legacy events, and refactor the `save/route.ts` to dynamically compile `[year].json`.

### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Author Array Support
- @bo approved the "Author Array Support Blueprint".
- Action: I will modify `PresentationsManager.tsx` and `PostersManager.tsx` to support the new array format. I will update `migrate_2022.js` to parse legacy comma-separated strings into this new format. Finally, I will update `archive/[year]/page.tsx` to conditionally render the new array schema and underline the `isPresenter` author.

### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Tidy File Paths & Uniqueness
- @bo approved the blueprint.
- Action: I updated the `upload` and `check-file` API routes with regex to strip `(Room ...)` strings from the session name before creating the directory.
- Action: I updated the `PresentationsManager` and `PostersManager` filename generation logic. They now extract the selected `presenter` author, grab their last name, and concatenate it with the first 2 words of the `title`. This guarantees safe and descriptive uniqueness.

### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Artifact Tracker Integration
- @bo approved the fuzzy-matching tracker blueprint.
- Action: I rewrote `scratch/download_tracker.py`. It now loads `master_workshops.json` to find talks that lack a `presentation_file`.
### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Tracker Restoration & Unmapped Injection
- @bo approved the unmapped injection workflow.
- Action: I updated `scratch/download_tracker.py` to process two lists: `tasks` (files matching a pre-existing Master JSON talk) and `unmapped` (the remaining 500+ legacy links).
- Action: I rendered a two-tiered UI separating these lists, giving the unmapped links a green "Inject & Download" button.
- Action: I updated the `/download_remote` endpoint. When `inject=true`, it parses the legacy filename to guess the author, downloads the file to `[year]/Unknown_Session/`, and appends a brand new presentation record directly into `master_workshops.json` with the file and URL attached.
### @dev SCoT Log: Executing Visual Previews
- @bo approved the preview generator architecture.
- Action: I built `scratch/preview_generator.py` utilizing `PyMuPDF`. It extracts the first page as a `.png` for Presentations/Posters, and pulls the first 100 words into a `.txt` for Abstracts.
- Action: I integrated this script directly into the Node.js API `upload/route.ts` via `child_process.exec` and into the Python `download_tracker.py` `/download_remote` endpoint.
- Action: I created `src/frontend/src/app/api/manager/preview/route.ts` to statically serve these dynamically generated `.png` and `.txt` files directly to the Manager UI.
- Action: I built the `PreviewHover.tsx` React component, which leverages `onMouseEnter` to fetch and render the previews in a sleek absolute-positioned tooltip.
- Action: I ran the browser subagent to inject an unmapped presentation and hover over the generated link. It successfully generated the PNG preview and displayed it in the hover tooltip!
